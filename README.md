# AMS Attendance App

Single page application designed to assist school administrators. Rather than pen and paper, school administrators are able to create and update teacher schedules, track staff attendance, and assign class coverages all within this single page application.

Any school's staff schedule is complex, and tracking staff attendance and assigning coverages for absent teachers can be difficult:

School administrators can mark staff members absent, and generate an easy-to-follow list of classes that will need coverages that day:

Once a staff member is marked absent, the app automatically generates a list of present staff members available that day for coverages:

Within just a few clicks, admin are able to clearly see what teachers have been assigned coverages. What used to take up to an hour each morning now takes only a few minutes!
